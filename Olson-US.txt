As a physics professor,  
I want to share simulations with my students, 
So that I can provide my students with illustrations of the material we cover in class. 
 
As a physics student, 
I want to practice solving a specific category of physics problems, 
So that I can practice material I struggle with. 
 
As an engineer, 
I want to have simple physics equations solved automatically, 
So that I don’t make waste time or make dumb mistakes.
