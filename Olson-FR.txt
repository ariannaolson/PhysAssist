The system shall contain equations, constant definitions, and variable definitions partitioned by subject matter.

The system shall allow users to select an equation from a subject to compute or simulate.

The system shall display with any selected equation the descriptions of each of its variables, terms, and constants.

The system shall have each variable in a selected equation either:
1.	Accept a value by user input, or 
2.	Compute the value of the variable and return it as the output of the equation.

The system shall give the option of running a simulation if and only if the selected equation is a function of time.

The system shall increment a simulation forward or backward by a user-specified metric interval of time when a user selects the forward or backward arrow.
